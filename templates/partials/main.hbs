<div id="ses-id-main" 
  <h2>ses-id-main</h2>

  <p>This content is loaded from ./templates/partials/main.hbs via ./templates/index.hbs</p>
  <p>Edit all partials in ./templates/partials to not only change this content, but also scripts that are loaded.</p>
  <p>Most importantly you should change all 'id' names like 'ses-id-main' to match the name of your feature</p>
  <p>Do the same for all files and routes that contain the 'id' placeholder. Rename and edit them to match your feature name.</p>
